    "This notebook implements an **Imputation Experiment**, designed to evaluate different imputation techniques for handling missing data. The experiment consists of **three imputation tests**, each focusing on a different attribute and missing data mechanism. The process for each test follows these four steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attribute Selection & Missing Data Simulation** – An attribute is chosen, and missing values are artificially introduced following a specific missing data mechanism:  \n",
    "   - **MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)**  \n",
    "   - **MAR (Missing at Random)**  \n",
    "   - **MNAR (Missing Not at Random)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Imputation Method Selection & Implementation** – One of the following imputation techniques is programmed to replace the missing values:  \n",
    "   - **Default Value Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **Random Sample Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **Time-based Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **Regression Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **Predictive Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **Similarity-based Imputation**  \n",
    "   - **MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Imputation Execution** – The selected method is applied to fill in the missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation of Imputation Performance** – The effectiveness of the imputation method is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each test uses a different attribute, a different imputation technique, and a distinct missing data mechanism to provide a comprehensive analysis of imputation methods. The notebook contains all necessary details to understand and reproduce the experiments, including attribute selection, missing data introduction, imputation method implementation, and evaluation results.\n",
