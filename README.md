## About This Repository
This repository contains our submission for Assignment 2 of CSI4142 - Fundamentals of Data Science. The focus of this assignment is **Data Cleaning**, specifically:
- Duplicate detection
- Data validation processes
- Imputation for missing values

The assignment is implemented entirely in **Python** and documented using **Jupyter Notebooks** to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and clarity in our analysis.

## Repository Structure
This repository consists of three branches:

1. **Main**: Contains only this README file. 

2. **dataset-1**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for cleaning data using a "Clean Data Checker." This tool detects various types of errors such as:
   - Data type errors
   - Range errors
   - Format inconsistencies
   - Duplicate entries
   - Missing values, etc.

3. **dataset-2**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook focusing on data imputation. This includes testing different imputation techniques such as:
   - Mean/Median/Mode imputation
   - Regression-based imputation
   - Correlation-based imputation

Each dataset and its respective processing are thoroughly explained within their respective Jupyter Notebooks.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_directory>
   ```

2. Checkout the branch you want to work with:
   ```bash
   git checkout dataset-1   # For Clean Data Checker
   git checkout dataset-2   # For Data Imputation
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Navigate to the corresponding notebook and run the cells sequentially.
